automatically created when the Odoo **Accounting** application is installed. To manage or configure
additional fiscal positions, navigate to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Fiscal
Positions`.

The following fiscal positions are available by default:

.. image:: canada/l10n-ca-fiscal-positions.png
   :alt: The default fiscal positions for the Canada localization in Odoo Accounting.

.. note::
   When considering what taxes to be applied, it is the province where the delivery occurs that
   matters. Therefore, delivery is the responsibility of the vendor and is accounted for at the
   customer location.

.. example::
   - A delivery is made to a customer from another province.
        Set the fiscal position on the customer's record to the province of the customer.
   - A customer from another province comes to pick up products.
        No fiscal position should be set on the customer's record.
   - An international vendor doesn't charge any tax, but taxes are charged by the customs broker.
        Set the fiscal position on the vendor's record to *International*.
   - An international vendor charges provincial tax.
        Set the fiscal position on the vendor's record to your position.

=============

Cash discounts can be configured from :menuselection:`Accounting app --> Payment Terms`. Each
payment term can be set up with a cash discount and reduced tax.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`../accounting/customer_invoices/cash_discounts`

Writing checks
==============

The Canadian localization allows users to print checks for vendor payments. Be sure the *Canadian
Checks Layout* (`l10n_ca_check_printing`) module for the CA localization is :ref:`installed
<general/install>`.

To enable check printing from Odoo, navigate to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Settings` and find the :guilabel:`Vendor Payments` section. From here, tick the :guilabel:`Checks`
checkbox to reveal several fields for check configuration.

Select a :guilabel:`Check Layout` from the drop-down menu:

- :guilabel:`Print Check (Top) - CA`
- :guilabel:`Print Check (Middle) - CA`
- :guilabel:`Print Check (Bottom) - CA`

Next, choose whether or not to enable the :guilabel:`Multi-Pages Check Stub` checkbox.

Optionally set a :guilabel:`Check Top Margin`, :guilabel:`Check Left Margin`, or :guilabel:`Check
Right Margin` if required.

Tick the :guilabel:`Print Date Label` checkbox if a date label is required.

Once all check configurations are complete, :guilabel:`Save` the settings.

.. tip::
   Some of the check formats may require pre-printed paper from a third party vendor.
   `Pre-printed checks from checkdepot.net <https://checkdepot.net/collections/odoo-checks>`_ are
   recommended.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`../accounting/payments/pay_checks`

Receive pre-authorized debits
=============================

Pre-authorized debits are a method for receiving payments from customers, where the customer
authorizes the business to withdraw funds from their bank account on a recurring basis. This
functionality is commonly used for subscriptions, recurring invoices, and other regular payments.

In the Odoo Canadian localization, pre-authorized debits are facilitated through an
:doc:`integration with Stripe <../payment_providers/stripe>`.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`Setting up payment providers <../payment_providers>`
   - `Stripe's pre-authorized debit payments documentation
     <https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit>`_

.. _l10n_ca/cpa005:

|CPA| 005 file to pay vendors
=============================

To use the |CPA| 005 file to pay vendors, first configure the :ref:`Bank journal
<l10n_ca/cpa005/bank-journal>` and :ref:`Vendor <l10n_ca/cpa005/vendor>`. Then, follow the
:ref:`workflow <l10n_ca/cpa005/workflow>`.

.. _l10n_ca/cpa005/bank-journal:

Configuration
-------------

Bank journal
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Navigate to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals` and then select the
:guilabel:`Bank` journal.

In the :guilabel:`Bank` journal record, select the :guilabel:`Outgoing Payments` tab.

Be sure :guilabel:`Canadian EFT` is listed under the :guilabel:`Payment Method`.

In the :guilabel:`Canadian EFT/CPA configuration`, configure the following fields:

- :guilabel:`Destination Data Center`: 5-digit ID provided by the bank, needed for generating a
  Canadian EFT file (CPA 005).
- :guilabel:`Originator ID`: 10-digit code supplied by the bank, needed for generating a Canadian
  EFT file (CPA 005).

  .. important::
     Some banks require the :guilabel:`Originator ID` to combine the :guilabel:`Destination Data
     Center` ID with the routing number. Please check with the bank for the expected format.

- :guilabel:`Next File Creation Number (FCN)`: used when validating a Canadian EFT batch payment and
  is printed in the XML file. The |FCN| is a 4-digit sequence from `0001` to `9999`.

  .. important::
     Some banks require a specific |FCN| number, please check with the bank.

  .. tip::
     If any details of the |FCN| need to be adjusted, go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Technical
     --> Sequences` and search for `FCN`.

Next, select the :guilabel:`Journal Entries` tab and configure the following fields:

- :guilabel:`Account Number`: Select an existing bank account number or :ref:`create a new one
  <bank_accounts/number>` by selecting the :icon:`oi-arrow-right` :guilabel:`(Internal link)` icon.

  Be sure to select a :guilabel:`Bank`, set a :guilabel:`Financial Institution ID Number`, and to
  enable :guilabel:`Send Money`.
- :guilabel:`Bank`: Automatically selected depending on the :guilabel:`Account Number`.

.. important::
   To validate the bank account, the user **must** have the permission to do so. To confirm,
   navigate to :menuselection:`Settings --> Users & Companies --> Users`, select the user, and in
   the :guilabel:`Access Rights` tab find the :guilabel:`Accounting` section.

   From here, make sure the :guilabel:`Bank` field is set to :guilabel:`Validate bank account`.

.. _l10n_ca/cpa005/vendor:

Vendor
~~~~~~

Navigate to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Vendors --> Vendors` and choose a vendor to set up their
bank account information.

In the :guilabel:`Accounting` tab, be sure to configure :guilabel:`Bank Accounts`.

.. _l10n_ca/cpa005/workflow:

Workflow
--------

First, :ref:`create the vendor bills <vendor_bills/create>`.

Then, select the vendor bills and :ref:`register the payment <vendor_bills/payment>`, if using full
bills, select the payment method :guilabel:`Canadian EFT`.

Next, create a new vendor payment by navigating to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Vendor -->
Payments` and select :guilabel:`New`. Configure the following fields:

- :guilabel:`Payment Type`: select :guilabel:`Send`.
- :guilabel:`Vendor`: select the vendor to assign to this payment.
- :guilabel:`Ammount`: set a payment amount.
- :guilabel:`Date`: select the date of the payment.
- :guilabel:`Memo`: write in a memo description.
- :guilabel:`Journal`: select :guilabel:`Bank`.
- :guilabel:`Payment Method`: select :guilabel:`Canadian EFT`.
- :guilabel:`EFT/CPA transaction code`: select the desired transaction code.
- :guilabel:`Vendor Bank Account`: select the vendor's bank account.

Finally, create a batch payment by navigating to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Vendors -->
Payments`. Select the checkboxes for each of the vendor payments to include in the batch, then
select the :guilabel:`Create Batch` button to create a new batch payment.

.. tip::
   The payments included in a batch are not restricted by the same vendor.

Existing batch payments can be managed from :menuselection:`Accounting --> Vendors --> Batch
Payments`. The export :file:`.txt` file displays in the chatter of the batch payment.

.. note::
   Please be aware that after importing the :file:`.txt` file to the bank, it may take up to 48
   hours to process the payment. Plan ahead if a deadline exists, such as payroll, to avoid legal
   issues.

.. important::
   Please validate the batch payment only once the date is confirmed. It is difficult to modify a
   validated batch payment.
